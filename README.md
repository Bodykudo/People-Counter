# People-Counter
People Counter is a class project for the Medical Physics course.
It was needed for each group to come up with an idea using Ultrasonic Sensor and Arduino UNO that can be used in the medical field.
Our idea was to make a device that can control the capacity of the room, it can count people going in and going out of a room, and whenever it reaches its maximum capacity it rings out.

The circuit created for this device:
